# Hollywood - The Game (Windows only)
In this tantalizing rendition of a classic kids game, one is presented with a randomly selected movie title (from a list of 1000 IMDB movies) with its consonants stripped. A few allowed characters (vowels, numbers, symbols) are displayed whereas the stripped consonants are represented with an underscore '`_`'.

If your guessed letter is among the movie-title's alphabets, that letter will now be shown. If wrong, you will lose a letter from the word `HOLLYWOOD`.

The game ends when you have no more characters left in `HOLLYWOOD`.

On choosing to play the game again, the Win/Loss counter will update in the top right corner.

On guessing the movie title without losing all `Hollywood` lives, one is greeted with the majestic success screen!
